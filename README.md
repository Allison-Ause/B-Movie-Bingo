# B MOVIE BINGO

Gather with friends or play alone. This app lets you select the genre of movie you're about to watch and from that, it generates a bingo board filled randomly with classic tropes from that genre.

Current TODO LIST:

[x] Create board state in useGame
[x] Set board state to shuffled data
[x] Figure out how to hand specific data based on selected genre
[x] Toggle dobbed or not dobbed with supported styling
[] Place switch case setBoard in a utils function for easy reuse
[] Win conditions check in useGame
[] Dope animation effect for win (based on genre?!)
// GIFS FROM MOVIES? OLD SCHOOL 8BIT WINNER LOGO
// use z-index
[] Board reset button and functionality for reshuffling board state
